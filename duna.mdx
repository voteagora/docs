In the world of decentralized governance, transparency isn't just a feature—it's the foundation of trust. But transparency without structure is chaos. That's where Duna comes in.

Duna is Agora's answer to a fundamental challenge facing every DAO: how do you maintain a clear, searchable record of your community's decisions, reports, and important documents while keeping everything accessible and engaging for your members?

Think of Duna as your DAO's digital town hall—a place where quarterly reports live alongside community discussions, where important documents are stored securely but remain discoverable, and where governance transparency becomes a living, breathing part of your community rather than just a compliance checkbox.

## The Problem Duna Solves

Every DAO faces the same challenge: as your community grows and governance becomes more complex, you need a way to maintain transparency without drowning in disorganized information.

Traditional approaches often fall short:

- **Scattered Documentation**: Important reports and documents end up scattered across Discord, Notion, Google Drive, and other platforms
- **Lost Context**: Community discussions about reports get separated from the reports themselves
- **Compliance Nightmares**: Regulatory requirements demand structured documentation, but most DAOs struggle to maintain it
- **Community Disengagement**: When information is hard to find, members stop looking, creating a transparency paradox

Duna transforms this chaos into clarity by providing a unified platform where your DAO's governance story unfolds in real-time, with every report, document, and discussion woven together into a coherent narrative.

## What is Duna?

Duna isn't just another content management system—it's a governance transparency platform built specifically for the unique needs of decentralized communities. Built on top of Agora's governance infrastructure, Duna provides the structure and tools your DAO needs to maintain professional-grade documentation while fostering community engagement.

At its core, Duna gives you three essential capabilities:

**Quarterly Reports Management**: People with permissions can create posts using the text editor and attach documents. This is where the discussion happens—each post becomes a focal point for community conversation about your DAO's direction and performance.

**Document Library**: People with permissions can upload documents for viewing; they're stored securely and can be accessed by everyone, creating a shared knowledge base for your DAO.

**Community Engagement**: Transform static content into living discussions through comments and replies. While only people with permissions can create posts and upload documents, everyone can participate in the conversation.

## How Duna Works

Duna operates on a simple but powerful principle: **structure enables transparency, and transparency builds trust**. Here's how it brings this principle to life:

### Quarterly Reports

Quarterly reports in Duna are posts that combine rich text content with attached documents. People with permissions can create these posts using DunaEditor, a TipTap-based editor that provides formatting tools for professional reports. Each report becomes a focal point for community discussion, with threaded comments allowing members to ask questions, provide feedback, and engage in meaningful dialogue about your DAO's direction and performance.

The editor automatically handles HTML generation and sanitization, so content creators can focus on their message while Duna handles the technical details.

### Documents

Documents in Duna are stored on IPFS through Pinata integration, making your DAO's files decentralized and resilient. People with permissions can upload documents up to 10MB in any file format, from simple text files to complex financial reports. Once uploaded, documents become part of a searchable archive that everyone can access, creating a shared knowledge base for your community.

Only admins can access the archive functionality, ensuring proper content management while maintaining the decentralized nature of your documentation.

## Integration with the Agora Ecosystem

Duna doesn't exist in isolation—it's designed to work seamlessly with the broader Agora governance platform. When you enable Duna for your DAO, it appears on your main info page, creating a natural hub where governance information and community engagement converge.

This integration means that Duna becomes part of your governance workflow rather than a separate tool your community has to remember to use. Members can move seamlessly between voting on proposals, reading quarterly reports, and engaging in community discussions—all within the same ecosystem they already trust for their governance needs.

## Setting Up Duna for Your DAO

Getting started with Duna is straightforward, but the setup process reflects the thoughtful design philosophy behind the system. Duna is controlled by a tenant-level toggle, ensuring that you can enable it when your DAO is ready without disrupting existing workflows.

The setup process involves three key steps:

**1. Enable the Feature**: Add the duna toggle to your tenant configuration and set it to enabled.

**2. Configure Permissions**: Set up forum permissions that align with your DAO's governance structure. You can grant users the ability to create topics, manage content, upload attachments, or perform administrative functions based on their roles and responsibilities.

**3. Configure Storage**: Set up your IPFS storage through Pinata integration. This ensures that your documents are stored in a decentralized, resilient manner that aligns with your DAO's values.

## Permissions and Access Control

Duna uses a tiered permission system that balances community participation with content management:

**Content Creation**: Only people with specific permissions can create posts and upload documents. This ensures quality control while maintaining the integrity of your DAO's documentation.

**Community Participation**: Everyone can comment, reply, and participate in discussions. This keeps your community engaged and informed without requiring special permissions.

**Administrative Control**: Only admins can archive documents, posts, and comments. They're also the only ones who can change permissions, ensuring that your DAO's governance structure remains secure and controlled.

## Looking Ahead

Duna represents Agora's commitment to solving the real challenges that DAOs face as they mature and grow. While the current feature set addresses the core needs of governance transparency, the system is designed to evolve with your community's needs.

Future enhancements might include advanced search capabilities, automated report generation, integration with external data sources, and enhanced collaboration tools that make it even easier for your community to create and maintain the documentation that builds trust and enables effective governance.

## Getting Started

Ready to transform your DAO's transparency and community engagement? Getting started with Duna is simple:

1. **Enable Duna** in your tenant configuration
2. **Set up permissions** for your content creators and moderators

Duna isn't just a tool—it's a foundation for building the kind of transparent, engaged community that makes decentralized governance work. By providing structure for your transparency and engagement for your content, Duna helps you build the trust that every successful DAO needs.

The future of governance isn't just about making decisions—it's about making decisions that your community understands, supports, and can learn from. Duna gives you the tools to make that future a reality.
