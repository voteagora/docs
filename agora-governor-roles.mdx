# Governor Roles

This documentation covers the Governor Manager and Admin roles for Agora Governor versions v1.0 through v1.2.

## Role Overview

When deploying an Agora Governor contract, two critical addresses must be defined:
- Governor Manager
- Governor Admin

## Governor Manager Role

The Manager role has a focused set of permissions designed for proposal creation.

### Permissions
The Manager has a single but important capability:
- Create proposals without meeting the proposal threshold requirement

### Implementation Recommendations
- Can be an Externally Owned Account (EOA) or a multisig
- Suitable for active community members or teams responsible for regular proposal creation
- Should be assigned to trusted entities as they can bypass proposal thresholds

## Governor Admin Role

The Admin role carries significant power, comparable to the timelock contract itself. This role should be handled with extreme care.

### Permissions
The Admin can bypass the governance process for the following actions:

**Proposal Management**
- Update deadlines of active proposals
- Cancel proposals
- Update proposal types of active proposals

**Governance Parameters**
- Modify voting delay
- Adjust voting period
- Update proposal threshold
- Create or modify proposal types (including quorum & approval thresholds)

**Role Management**
- Update the admin address
- Update the manager address

**Module Control**
- Enable or disable voting modules (external contracts that can override proposal creation and voting logic)

### Security Recommendations
Due to the extensive powers of the Admin role:
- **Strongly recommended** to be implemented as a multisig with a high signature threshold
- Typically represents the security council
- Should have strict operational procedures and multiple signers

## Role Management

### Disabling Roles
Both the Manager and Admin roles can be effectively disabled:
- Transfer the role to the zero address (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`)
- Can be re-enabled through a governance proposal
- Timelock (governance) retains the ability to restore the roles

### Important Notes
- The timelock (governance) always maintains access to the same functions as the admin
- Role changes should be carefully considered and executed
- Disabling roles provides an additional security option if needed
