1. **Seamless Integration with Agora Governance:**
    
    By launching your token with Agora, you ensure that governance capabilities (like ERC20Votes or Partial Delegation) are tightly integrated from day one. Your token becomes a first-class citizen in onchain proposals, delegations, and governance modules, reducing friction as your community scales.
    
2. **MICA-Compliant ICOs:**
    
    For projects targeting European markets or other jurisdictions that require compliance with emerging crypto regulations, Agora Launch supports MICA-compliant ICOs. This ensures that your token distribution adheres to regulatory standards, offering transparency and investor protection. Launching under MICA guidelines can solidify trust with stakeholders and preempt regulatory hurdles.
    
3. **Flexible Claims Models:**
    
    Agora Launch supports multiple token claim flows, allowing you to choose the model best suited to your community’s needs and values:
    
    - **Hard Claim:** Token recipients explicitly claim their tokens by initiating an onchain transaction (paying gas fees themselves). This model shifts operational costs to the recipient, fosters accountability, and makes distribution transparent.
    - **Soft Claim:** Tokens are distributed without requiring the recipient to pay gas. Agora (or your treasury) can cover the claim process, lowering the barrier to entry and encouraging broader participation—ideal if you want to cast a wide net and ensure inclusivity. You can also make sure that you are rewarding address for other onchain or
    - **Hard Claim + Soft Claim Hybrid:** Combine both approaches to create a tiered or phased distribution strategy. For example, allow early adopters to “hard claim” their tokens, reflecting their higher level of engagement, while later participants benefit from a “soft claim” model that removes friction. This hybrid approach can balance user effort, cost, and overall community growth.
4. **Token or NFT—Your Choice:**
    
    Agora Launch supports both ERC-20 (fungible tokens) and ERC-721 (NFTs). Launch a flexible, high-volume token for traditional “one token, one vote” governance, or opt for NFTs for a more curated, membership-like experience. Mix and match these asset types as your ecosystem grows and diversifies.
    
5. **Developer-Friendly Tooling:**
    
    With robust APIs, SDKs, and documentation, Agora Launch empowers developers to integrate token minting and distribution seamlessly into their existing workflows. 
    
6. **Expert Guidance and Best Practices:**
    
    Beyond the technology stack, Agora offers guidance on tokenomics, distribution schedules, and community-building strategies. Backed by our Runbooks and best-in-class support, you’ll have access to proven frameworks for initial governance setup, electing stewards, managing claim windows, and scaling your community.
    

### Steps to Launch Your Token with Agora

1. **Define Your Tokenomics and Governance Vision:**
    
    Start by articulating your governance goals, participation incentives, and desired regulatory stance. Determine whether you need MICA compliance or simply want a straightforward ERC20 or NFT launch.
    
2. **Select a Claims Model:**
    
    Decide if you want a Hard Claim, Soft Claim, or a Hybrid approach. Consider your audience’s familiarity with onchain transactions, their comfort with gas fees, and how quickly you want broad distribution.
    
3. **Consult With Agora’s Experts (Optional):**
    
    Depending on your Agora plan, you can tap into advisory services. Our team can help you refine distribution parameters, ensure compliance, and integrate voting modules upfront.
    
4. **Configure Your Token in the Agora Dashboard:**
    
    Set up your token’s parameters—name, symbol, supply, distribution rules, and claim model. Enable governance extensions like ERC20Votes or Partial Delegation right out of the gate.
    
5. **Deploy and Launch:**
    
    Deploy your token contract with a single click or via CLI tools. For MICA-compliant ICOs, Agora provides a streamlined process with built-in transparency and reporting features.
    
6. **Distribute and Engage:**
    
    Open up claim windows, invite community members to participate, and track adoption. Use Agora’s client interface to delegate voting power, sponsor proposals, and conduct initial onchain actions that reinforce engagement and trust.
    
7. **Grow Your Community and Governance:**
    
    As more participants claim tokens and delegates step forward, leverage Agora’s governance modules to shape proposals, adjust voting thresholds, and evolve towards more decentralized, community-driven governance.
