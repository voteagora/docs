## Governance 101

Web3 protocols are the backbone of decentralized systems, composed of smart contracts that operate based on predefined rules and parameters. Unlike traditional software, these protocols are not controlled by a single entity but are governed by their communities. This is where governance comes into play - it's the mechanism that allows protocols to evolve and adapt.

The community governs the protocol using a token. This token typically takes the form of an ERC-20 or ERC-721 token on Ethereum. Community members propose changes to the protocol via proposals, and the community votes on these proposals. The voting power of each member is proportional to the number of tokens they hold or have been delegated.

If the proposal passes, the transactions attached to the proposal are executed. If the proposal does not pass, no change is made. This process is repeated over time, allowing the protocol to evolve and adapt to changing circumstances and requirements through the collective wisdom of the community.

For example, let's say that you have a decentralized lending protocol and one of the parameters is your annual interest rate. When you deploy the protocol you set it to 3.2%. As the macroeconomic conditions of the world change, you might want to change that number to bring it up or down. Community members that have the ability to propose might create a proposal and attach a transaction such as:

```
setInterestRate(0.033)
```

If the proposal passes, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) will execute this transaction and the function setInterestRate will be set to 0.033 or 3.3%. If the proposal fails to pass it will stay at 3.2%. Other members of the community can then come and propose other values. This process will continue until the right number is decided upon by the community, or they might find that there is no number everyone can agree on and it stays put at 3.2%.

Now imagine this process repeating for a complex protocol with dozens of parameters.
