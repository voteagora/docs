## Open Source

Agora's contracts and governor client are completely open source!  You're welcome to fork and build on top, and propose changes back.

## Core

Agora's Core offering is the entry-level tier, which includes all the open-source offering, deployed and hosted with business-grade SLAs and basic customization taken care of for you!

## Enterprise

For larger DAOs that need richer and deeper features, we offer the Core, plus integration and customization to ensure governance becomes a competitive advantage.
