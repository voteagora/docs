# Governance Technical Overview

This document provides a technical overview of how Agora's governance system works, including its key components and the lifecycle of proposals.

## System Components

### Core Components

- **Token**
  - Tracks token holder balances
  - Manages voting power of delegates
  - Enables voting on proposals

- **Governor**
  - Provides primary access control logic
  - Processes proposals and associated votes
  - Determines proposal success or failure
  - Manages voting periods and thresholds

- **Timelock**
  - Receives instructions from governor for successful proposals
  - Implements time delay for stakeholder response
  - Executes approved instructions after delay period

### Additional Components

- **Modules** (e.g., approval voting)
  - Provide optional voting strategies
  - Enable features like multiple choice voting
  - Extend governor functionality

### Privileged Roles

- **Governor Manager**
  - Trusted address with proposal submission rights
  - Can bypass proposal threshold requirements
  - Typically controlled by the foundation initially

- **Security Council**
  - Trusted multisig with protocol upgrade capabilities
  - Can perform emergency upgrades when needed
  - Ensures protocol safety during critical changes

- **Governor Admin**
  - Trusted multisig with broad system privileges
  - Enables manual execution and intervention
  - Can be same address as Security Council (optional)
  - Acts as last-resort safeguard

## Proposal Lifecycle

### Initial Launch Configuration

At launch, the system is configured for maximum safety and control:

1. **High Proposal Threshold**
   - Set initially high to restrict proposal creation
   - Only Governor Manager (foundation) can propose initially
   - Enables controlled governance rollout

2. **Manual Protocol Upgrades**
   - Protocol upgrades executed manually at first
   - Continues until successful proposal track record
   - Ensures maximum safety during early phase

### Example Proposal Types

#### 1. Token Transfer Proposal

- Fully executed on-chain
- Standard governance process
- Automated execution through timelock

#### 2. Normal Protocol Upgrade

- Requires Security Council execution
- Manual implementation for safety
- Additional verification layer

#### 3. Emergency Protocol Upgrade

- Bypasses standard governance process
- Direct Security Council execution
- Reserved for critical situations

## Progressive Decentralization

As the governance system matures:

1. **Proposal Threshold Reduction**
   - Gradually lower proposal requirements
   - Enable broader community participation
   - Allow smaller token holders to propose

2. **Upgrade Process Evolution**
   - Move toward fully on-chain upgrades
   - Reduce manual intervention
   - Increase automation of execution

3. **Community Empowerment**
   - Expand voting power distribution
   - Enhance proposal creation access
   - Foster decentralized decision-making

This progressive approach ensures the governance system can evolve safely while maintaining security and stability.
