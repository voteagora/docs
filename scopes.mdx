# Scoped Proposal Types

Scoped Proposal Types are a powerful tool to limit what kinds of actions proposals in a DAO can take. Instead of allowing any contract call, you can define **specific, safe actions** that certain proposal types are allowed to perform.

---

## What Is a Proposal Type?

A **Proposal Type** is a template that defines:

- **Voting rules**: quorum and approval thresholds
- **Name and description** of the type
- **Module** (optional): a contract that can exclusively use this type
- A list of **Scopes**: rules for what this proposal is allowed to do

---

## What Is a Scope?

A **Scope** is a rule that says:

<Hint type="tip">
“This proposal type can only call this function on this contract, and only if the inputs match specific conditions.”
</Hint>

Each scope is bound to:

- A **contract address**
- A **function selector** (e.g. `transfer(address,uint256)`)
- A set of **parameter rules** (with comparisons)
- A **description** for clarity

---

## Example Use Case

Let’s say your DAO has a proposal type called **"Treasury Settings"**. You only want it to update the budget — not move funds.

1. **Create a Proposal Type:**
   - Name: `Treasury Settings`
   - Quorum: `10%`
   - Approval Threshold: `60%`

2. **Assign a Scope:**
   - Contract: `Treasury` contract
   - Function: `updateBudget(uint256)`
   - Rule: `newBudget < 1,000,000 tokens`

Any proposal of this type must:
- Call the right contract and function
- Pass input checks
- Stay within the budget limit

If not, it’s **invalid**.

---

## Admin-Only Tools

Only the **Governor admin** or a **timelock** can manage scopes.

Available actions:

| Action              | Who can do it?       |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Create proposal type | Admin / Timelock     |
| Assign scope         | Admin / Timelock     |
| Disable scope        | Admin / Timelock     |
| Delete scope         | Admin / Timelock     |

---

## How Validation Works

When someone submits a proposal:

1. Each call is inspected
2. The contract + function is hashed into a **scope key**
3. If the key is allowed under the proposal type:
   - Parameters are **decoded**
   - Comparisons are **checked**
4. If everything passes, the proposal is valid

<Hint type="note">
This system currently supports basic types only: `uint`, `address`, and `bytes32`.
</Hint>

---

## Limits

- Max **5 scopes per contract/function combo** for each proposal type
- Supported data types:
  - `uint`
  - `address`
  - `bytes32`

---

## Summary

Scoped Proposal Types give DAOs granular control over what governance proposals are allowed to do. They help:

- Reduce the risk of rogue proposals
- Enable safe delegation to modules
- Scale governance safely as your DAO grows

By assigning clear scopes to proposal types, you create **permissioned governance**, without needing to trust proposal authors.

##  Who Is This For?

- DAO **Governors** and **Admins**
- Protocol **Engineers**
- Contract **Module Builders**
- Anyone defining **safe proposal flows**
