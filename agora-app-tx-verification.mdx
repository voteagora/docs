# Transaction Simulation & Verification

When a proposal is submitted on-chain, it's critical to ensure that what’s being executed is safe, transparent, and does exactly what the proposer intends. That’s where **Transaction Simulation & Verification** comes in.

This feature simulates the entire proposal execution **before it's ever executed**—using the **exact context of the governor, timelock, and the caller**. The simulation runs via [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/), assuming it's supported by the target chain, and provides deep insight into the behavior of the proposal.

## Why Simulation Matters

Blockchain governance comes with irreversible consequences. Once a proposal passes, there's no undo button. That’s why simulation and verification are vital:

- Catch unexpected side effects  
- Verify all contract interactions  
- Ensure calldata decodes as expected  
- Establish a full audit trail of proposal behavior before it's live  

By integrating simulation into the governance process, DAOs increase safety and trust for all voters.

We run the same simulations when a proposal is in draft mode, giving the creator peace of mind before posting to the chain.

Below is a tiny screenshot of the feature.

## What We Check

When a simulation runs, we verify a comprehensive set of checks.

### ✅ Reports All Events Emitted

We capture and display **every single event emitted** during proposal execution. This allows reviewers to:

- Confirm expected events (e.g. token transfers, role assignments)
- Detect unexpected or hidden contract behavior

### ✅ Reports All State Changes

We log all **changes to contract storage**, including:

- Updated variables  
- New values for mappings or arrays  
- Any modifications made during execution  

This helps confirm that the proposal impacts state exactly as intended—nothing more, nothing less.

### ✅ Decodes Target Calldata

All target calldata is:

- **Decoded into human-readable formats**  
- Matched against known ABI definitions  

This gives voters and reviewers confidence in the intent of each call and makes it easier to spot misconfigured or malicious data.

### ✅ Verifies All Targets on Etherscan

Each target address in the proposal is:

- Checked for **verified contract source code** on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)  
- Flagged if any address points to an unverified or proxy contract  

### ✅ Verifies All Touched Contracts on Etherscan

Even if the proposal doesn't directly target them, we:

- **Track every contract that gets touched**  
- Confirm verification status for those as well  

> Because malicious contracts often use `delegatecall` or indirect hops to hide behavior—we catch those too.

### ✅ Checks for `selfdestruct` in Targets

We analyze each target contract and verify that:

- The bytecode does **not** include the `selfdestruct` opcode  
- If present, this may indicate **dangerous or irreversible behavior**  

> Proposals attempting to execute contracts with `selfdestruct` will trigger a warning or fail simulation, depending on context.

### ✅ Checks for `selfdestruct` in Touched Contracts

Even contracts indirectly touched during execution are checked for `selfdestruct`. A warning is raised if any are found.

### ✅ Detects ETH Sent With Proposal Execution

We check whether:

- The proposal attempts to send **ETH along with a call**  
- If so, it is clearly reported for transparency  

This protects against silent ETH transfers or unintentional funding of contracts.

### ✅ Reports All ETH Balance Changes

We analyze **ETH inflows and outflows** for:

- Target contracts  
- Touched contracts  
- The timelock or DAO itself  

This ensures ETH movement is deliberate and easy to audit.

## Warnings

If something passes but raises a concern (e.g. unverifiable contracts or decoded calldata with unknown selectors), we **warn but do not block**. These warnings are meant to guide further manual review.

<Callout type="warning">
  Simulation may pass with warnings. These indicate unusual behavior or unverifiable components that require additional scrutiny.
</Callout>

## View on Tenderly

Each simulation links to the full Tenderly trace, including:

- Execution traces  
- Gas usage  
- Storage diffs  
- Event logs  

---

## Under the Hood

- Simulations run as if the **governor’s `execute()`** function is being called by the **timelock**, simulating the **final step** in the lifecycle of a proposal.
- The full context includes the actual proposer, governor, timelock, and the current block timestamp.
- We simulate against **forked mainnet state** (where supported), providing real-world fidelity.

## Who Benefits?

- **DAO Voters** get peace of mind knowing what they’re voting on  
- **Protocol Developers** can debug and verify proposals before submission  
- **Governance Facilitators** can provide richer documentation and transparency to the community

## Big thanks to [Seatbelt](https://github.com/Uniswap/governance-seatbelt) 🧷

This feature was **heavily inspired** by the amazing work in the [Seatbelt project](https://github.com/Uniswap/governance-seatbelt), which laid the groundwork for many of the ideas around pre-execution simulation, calldata decoding, and safety verification.

If you're curious about how proposal-level simulations can be structured, we highly recommend checking out their codebase.
