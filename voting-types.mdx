# Proposal Voting

Agora supports multiple voting mechanisms to accommodate different governance needs. Each proposal uses both a **voting type** (how votes are cast) and a **proposal type** (which defines quorum and approval thresholds).

## Core Voting Types

### Basic Voting
The standard voting mechanism where participants vote "for", "against", or "abstain". A proposal passes when:
- Total votes (for + abstain) exceed quorum
- For votes exceed the approval threshold percentage of (for + against) votes

### Approval Voting
Allows voters to choose among multiple options. The proposal passes if:
- Quorum is met
- Options are approved based on predefined approval criteria

### Optimistic Voting
A social signaling mechanism where proposals automatically pass unless significant opposition emerges:
- Automatically passes unless 12% vote against
- Cannot include on-chain transactions
- Used primarily for social consensus

### Snapshot Integration
- Fully off-chain voting imported from Snapshot
- Maintains compatibility with existing Snapshot proposals

## Understanding Proposal Configuration

Each proposal combines:
1. **Voting Type**: Determines how votes are cast (basic, approval, optimistic)
2. **Proposal Type**: Sets the quorum and approval threshold requirements

## Key Terms

### Quorum
The minimum voting weight required for a valid proposal, ensuring sufficient participation. Example: 400,000 OP tokens.

### Approval Threshold
The percentage of supporting votes needed versus opposing votes. Example: With 50% threshold:
- Requires (for)/(for + against) > 50%
- Must also meet quorum requirement
